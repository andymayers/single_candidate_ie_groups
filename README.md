single_candidate_ie_groups
==========================

A data file of super PACs and other independent political spending groups dedicated to benefitting one single candidate, along with the candidate's identity. Because of inherent opaqueness in IE groups' plans, it may be unclear whether a given committee or group is dedicated to a single candidate, but best attempts at accuracy will be made.

A rule of thumb will be that if a group spends or plans to focus at least 90% of its spending on one race it will be considered a single-candidate group.
